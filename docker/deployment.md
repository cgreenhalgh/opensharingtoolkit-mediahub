# Mediahub Deployment

Notes on deployment...

The scope (mark 1):

- reproducible by others
- hosted service for initial research partners (SaaS)
- small number of users

## Docker

...with [docker](http://www.docker.com/).

The idea (mark 1):

- one container per user (or user group)
- container hosts complete system, i.e. couchdb, node-based commands
- container includes reverse http proxy enforcing access control
- multiple mediahub containers run behind a single public reverse proxy 

In terms of initial security and http request routing:

- public web interface requires external clients to use https, so all communication (including http basic authentication) is encrypted
- public web interface forwards to respective container based on top-level path
- internal requests are all http (not https)

- container reverse proxy requires http basic authentication for all 'sensitive' URLs (e.g. writes, non-public reads); this will have been passed through by the public proxy so entered by user/browser and externally transported over https

- couchdb is set up with admin, hubreader and hubwriter generic users and requires valid user
- reverse proxy inserts Http authentication header for relevant URLs (post its own basic authentication of external requests)

## Installing docker

Install docker as per [docker ubuntu install guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) - I am testing with 14.04, latest docker (currently 1.1.0).

## Just testing...

There is a docker image `nginxdev` and makefile target which is an nginx VM exposed on port `8080`, which serves content from `nginxdev/html`. This is intended for use in development, i.e. when running couchdb outside of the deployment framework of docker/nginx.

## Initialising couchdb

You will need an initial version of the couchapp in a couchdb file in order to create/deploy instances.

Deploy the mediahub couchapp on a regular machine. Take a copy of the database file, `/var/lib/couchdb/mediahub.couch` to `mediahub/mediahub.couch`.

## Mediahub container

Runs:

- ubuntu 14.04 (aka `trusty`)
- nginx (1.4.6 from ubuntu `nginx`, or `stable` = 1.6.0 as of 2014-07-08 from  [nginx linux packages](http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#stable))
- couchdb (1.5.0, ubuntu `couchdb`)
- node and npm (v0.10.25 and 1.3.10, respectively, ubuntu `npm`)
- cfengine (3.6.0, [cfengine community distros](http://cfengine.com/cfengine-linux-distros/))
- (optionally) openssh-server

See [CFEngine in docker](https://cfengine.com/company/blog-detail/cfengine-and-docker-ensure-application-availability-and-container-integrity/) - for our purposes this is just a way of running several processes in one docker container.

Generic cfengine dockerfile is [`cfengine/Dockerfile`](cfengine/Dockerfile). Generic mediahub dockerfile is [`mediahub/Dockerfile`](mediahub/Dockerfile). Custom Dockerfile and other config is generated by the makefile in `mediahub-NAME` subdirectories:
```
make NAME=example run
```

Note that this will require an initial snapshot of the `mediahub.couch` database file in `mediahub\`. See above for instructions.

Each `mediahub-NAME` subdirectory includes `password`, the auto-generated password required to access that instance (username is instance name).

You should update the public-facing proxy configuration after running a new mediahub instance - see below (`make nginx`).

## Public web access

The common proxy front-end is build, run and updated by
```
make nginx
```

This will create proxy configs for each currently running mediahub container on the machine. These are configured with the current IP address of the container and assumes the internal firewall is sufficiently open for this to work.

## SSL certificate

[self-signed](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_faq.html#selfcert), for example. 
```
make nginx/server.key
```
